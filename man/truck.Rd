\title{Data on truck responses to a rough road profile}
\format{
numerical \code{4095 x 101} dataframe: \code{truck}
}
\usage{
data(truck)
}
\description{
These are simulated data of truck responses to a rough road at the high transient
event. The simulations have been made based on the fit of the so-called Slepian model
to a non-Gaussian rough road profile. Details can be found in the reference. The
responses provided are at 
the driver seat. There are 100 functional measurments, kept column-wise in the matrix.
Additionally, the time instants of the measurements are given as the first column in the matrix.
Since the package uses the so-called "lazy load", the matrix 
is directly available without an explicit load of the data, thus \code{data(truck)} does not need to be invoked.
Data were saved using \code{compress='xz'} option, which requires 3.5 or higher version of R.
The data are uploaded as a dataframe, thus \code{as.matrix(tire)} is needed if the matrix form is required.
