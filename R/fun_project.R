#' @title Projecting into spline spaces
#' 
#' @description  The projection of splines or functional data into the linear spline space spanned over a given set of knots.  
#' @param fdsp \code{Splinets}-object or a \code{n x (N+1)} matrix, a representation of \code{N} functions to be projected to 
#' the space spanned by a \code{Splinets}-basis over a specific set of knots;
#' If the parameter is a \code{Splinets}-object containing \code{N} splines, 
#' then it is orthogonally projected or represented in the basis that is specified by other parameters. 
#' If the paramater is a matrix, 
#' then it is treated as \code{N} piecewise constant functions with the arguments in the first column and the corresponding values of the functions in the remaining \code{N} columns. 
#' @param knots vector, the knots of the projection space, together with \code{smorder} fully characterizes the projection space; This parameter is overridden by the SLOT \code{basis@knots} of the \code{basis} input if this one is not \code{NULL}.
#' @param smorder integer, the order of smoothness of the projection space; This parameter is overridden by  the SLOT \code{basis@smorder} of the \code{basis} input if this one is not \code{NULL}.
#' @param periodic logical, a flag to indicate if B-splines will be of periodic type or not; In the case of periodic splines, the arguments of the input and the knots need to be within [0,1] or, otherwise, an error occurs and a message advising the recentering and rescaling data is shown. 
#' @param basis \code{Splinets}-object, the basis used for the representation of the projection of the input \code{fdsp};
#' @param type string, the choice of the basis in the projection space used only if the \code{basis}-parameter is not given; The following choices are available 
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{'bs'} for the unorthogonalized B-splines,
#'   \item \code{'spnt'} for the orthogonal splinet (the default),
#'   \item \code{'gsob'} for the Gramm-Schmidt (one-sided) OB-splines,
#'   \item \code{'twob'} for the two-sided OB-splines.
#'  } 
#' The default is \code{'spnt'}. 
#' @param graph logical, indicator if the illustrative plots are to be produced:
#'  \itemize{
#'   \item the splinet used in the projection(s) on the dyadic grid,
#'   \item the coefficients of the projection(s) on the dyadic grid,
#'   \item the input function(s),
#'   \item the projection(s).
#'  } ;
#' @return The value of the function is a list made of four elements
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \code{project$input} -- \code{fdsp}, when the input is a \code{Splinets}-object or a matrix with the first column in an increasing order,
#'   otherwise it is the input numeric matrix after ordering according to the first column, 
#'   \item \code{project$coeff} -- \code{N x (n-k+1)} matrix of the coefficients of representation of the projection of the input in the splinet basis,
#'   \item \code{project$basis} -- the spline basis,
#'   \item \code{project$sp} -- the \code{Splinets}-object containing the projected splines.
#'  } 
#' @details The obtained coefficients \eqn{\mathbf A = (a_{ji})} with respect to the basis allow to evaluate the splines \eqn{S_j} in the projection according to 
#' \deqn{
#' S_j=\sum_{i=1}^{n-k-1} a_{ji} OB_{i}, \,\, j=1,\dots, N,
#'  }
#' where \eqn{n} is the number of the knots (including the endpoints), \eqn{k} is the spline smoothness order, 
#' \eqn{N} is the number of the projected functions and  \eqn{OB_i}'s consitute the considered basis. 
#' The coefficient for the splinet basis are always evaluated and thus, for example, 
#' \code{PFD=project(FD,knots); ProjDataSplines=lincomb(PFD$coeff,PFD$basis)}
#' creates a \code{Splinets}-object made of the projections of the input functional data in \code{FD}.
#' If the input parameter \code{basis} is given, then the function utilizes this basis and does not 
#' need to build it. However, if \code{basis} is the B-spline basis, then the B-spline orthogonalization is performed anyway, 
#' thus the computational gain is smaller than in the case when \code{basis} is an orthogonal basis.
