#' @title Data on tire responses to a rough road profile
#'
#' @description These are simulated data of tire responses to a rough road at the high-transient
#' event. The simulations have been made based on the fit of the so-called Slepian model
#' to a non-Gaussian rough road profile. Further details can be found in the reference. The
#' responses provided are measured at the wheel and thus describing the tire response. 
#' There are 100 functional measurments, kept column-wise in the matrix.
#' Additionally, the time instants of the measurements are given as the first column in the matrix.
#' Since the package uses the so-called "lazy load", the matrix 
#' is directly available without an explicit load of the data.
#' This means that \code{data(tire)} does not need to be invoked.
#' The data were saved using \code{compress='xz'} option, which requires 3.5 or higher version of R.
#' The data are uploaded as a dataframe, thus \code{as.matrix(tire)} is needed if the matrix form is required.
