#' @title Data on truck responses to a rough road profile
#'
#' @description These are simulated data of truck responses to a rough road at the high transient
#' event. The simulations have been made based on the fit of the so-called Slepian model
#' to a non-Gaussian rough road profile. Details can be found in the reference. The
#' responses provided are at 
#' the driver seat. There are 100 functional measurments, kept column-wise in the matrix.
#' Additionally, the time instants of the measurements are given as the first column in the matrix.
#' Since the package uses the so-called "lazy load", the matrix 
#' is directly available without an explicit load of the data, thus \code{data(truck)} does not need to be invoked.
#' Data were saved using \code{compress='xz'} option, which requires 3.5 or higher version of R.
#' The data are uploaded as a dataframe, thus \code{as.matrix(tire)} is needed if the matrix form is required.
